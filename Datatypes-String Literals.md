# Datatypes-Read and Print a String in Python

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program to read a string from the user and then print it.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. Assign a variable named `men_stepped_on_the_moon`.
2. Use `input()` to read a string from the user and store it in the variable.
3. Print the value stored in the variable.

## 🧾 Program:
```
men_stepped_on_the_moon=input()
print(men_stepped_on_the_moon)
```
## Output:

<img width="840" height="234" alt="438098795-4f908af4-3ede-436b-ab3a-ce1aa9a7adc4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4188aa0a-f4d7-46d9-a7b3-9d07fe23bf1a" />
